# Sort #3 Challenge

# You are given a file of text, where each line contains a number (which may
# be either an integer or have decimal places). There will be no extra
# characters other than the number or the newline at the end of each line.
# Sort the lines in ascending order - such that the first line holds the
# (numerically) smallest number and the last line hold the (numerically)
# largest number.
