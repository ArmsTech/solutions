"""
There is a horizontal row of n cubes. Side length of each cube from left to
right is given. You need to create a new vertical pile of cubes. The new pile
should be such that if cubei is on cubej then sideLengthjâ‰¥sideLengthi. But at
a time, you can only pick either the leftmost or the rightmost cube only.
Print "Yes" if its possible, "No" otherwise.
