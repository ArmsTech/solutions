# Akuna Capital Python Coding Challenge 

> The basic idea behind this challenge is that you have been given access to
some sort of Python-based trading system, but it is very flawed. We want to
pull data from this system, analyze it, determine the "edge" (profitability
of our strategy) for each stock in the trading system based on this analysis
and calculate the total edge that we see. To be clear, the goal of this
challenge isn't to implement your own TradingSystem class, but to understand
the documentation below and try to interact with it. If you would like to
implement a mock TradingSystem class to test your script against, we would be
happy to review that as well.

For additional details see the files:

Please note that this challenge was completed in 2015. Also, one would need
the actual trade system to properly test this.

## Feedback

I was asked to continue the interview process. I chose not to. If anyone
reading this would like to know why, feel free to reach out.
