# NGINX Python Challenges

= 1 =

You have a standard nginx access.log file.
Print top ten most frequently logged IP addresses from that log.
Solve it with a) python only b) shell only.

= 2 =

You should design and implement Median Microservice.
It has API with two methods:
- /put - takes any integer;
- /median - returns the median for all the values for the last minute.

We will use t2.small EC2 instance for this service (2GB RAM, 1 vCPU).

Mind that this a task from the real world, so you can use any additional software you want.
Think about corner cases (a lot of values, etc)
